## About

### What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by **DigitalOcean**. During the month of `October`, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
- Organize an event
- Mentor others
- Donate directly to open source projects

---

### Rules

Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.
You can sign up anytime between **October 1** and **October 31**. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

- The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
- If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.
